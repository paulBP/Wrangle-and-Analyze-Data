# Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data

The tasks in this project are as follows:

Data wrangling, which consists of:
- Gathering data 
- Assessing data
- Cleaning data
- Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data
Reporting on :
1) your data wrangling efforts and 
2) your data analyses and visualizations
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

Dataset:

The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
